## One-time setup

Download and install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/):

- It's recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your NodeJs versions. Go to the nvm link and follow the instructions to install it.
- After you install nvm, while in the project's root directory, run `nvm use` to use the NodeJs version specified in the .nvmrc file. It might prompt you that you first need to install a specified version of NodeJs. Follow the instructions to install it and then run `nvm use` command again.

_If you want to install NodeJS manually, see .nvmrc file for the Node version you should use._
